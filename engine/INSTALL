To install, grab a copy of the MySQL or MariaDB source code (5.1 or later)
and run this:

sh config/autorun.sh
./configure --with-mysql=/home/you/mariadb-5.1/
make

Note that (this is currently a MySQL/MariaDB plugin limitation) you need
to build against the exact version you're going to be loading the plugin,
and also flags like DEBUG need to be identical. Otherwise things go boom.


When the build is ok, run this inside of MySQL/MariaDB:

SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'plugin_dir';
# this shows the directory you need to copy the shared library, then run
# sudo cp .libs/liboqgraph_engine.so <theplugindir>
# now you're ready to load the plugin into the running server
INSTALL PLUGIN oqgraph SONAME 'liboqgraph_engine.so';

Take a peek with SHOW PLUGINS or SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS
OQGRAPH should be there, active, and ready to use.

See the full docu for your next steps http://openquery.com/graph/doc

You can actually also unload a plugin from a running server.
In case of an engine, FLUSH TABLES first so there are no open tables.
UNINSTALL PLUGIN oqgraph;
You won't generally need this, but it can be nice during debugging.
