Maze example by Arjen Lentz (arjen@openquery.com)

Which real programmer doesn't remember writing an app to build a maze
of arbitrary size? The more adventurous would also write an algorithm
to find the shortest path through the maze.

Well, this demo does pretty much that, with direct SQL output.
It was implemented from scratch since the last time I did this was on
a DEC PDP-8 (VT78 terminal version) and an Acorn BBC/B. 25+ years ago!
I liked the little exercise. Indulgent, sure. But why not.

Of course, the finding of the shortest path is handled by OQGRAPH.
