The earliest substantial dataset size OQGRAPH example blogpost was
based on this example.

This means we can include a full MySQL dump for you in the repo,
but we'll also give you the xslt stylesheets to do your own.

See INSTALL for further details.


TODO
====

1) The stylesheet output currently is not quite clean.
- The root entry needs to be adjusted (NULL instead of blank parent link),
- and the nodes with empty names or descriptions need to be NULL.
The SQL dump has all this, but if you redo the process you need to fix.
If you can fix up the stylesheet to handle this, that'd be great!


2) Example of this type of traversal in plain SQL, to show difference.
Most likely sensible approach:
The main 'tol' table already uses the adjacency model (id,parent).
For the given tol examples, we don't need a smart shortest path search,
can can just walk from A back to "life on earth" and do the same for B.
Then we see whether the A and B paths intersect before reaching the top;
if so, we can remove the rest of that path beyond the intersection.

Rather than creating a dependency on scripting, it would be nicest
to show it in SQL, like a stored procedure. Conceptually it's
straightforward, but it'll still be a lot of queries, doing the
to-root walks, and thus it'll be slow.
