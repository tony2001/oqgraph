======================================================================

Place your example datasets/trickery for OQGRAPH engine here!
Simply create a subdirectory with a sensible name, and put in any
scripts/data as well as an INSTALL file detailing how to work things.
For transformations (xslt from RDF, etc), do give exact instructions!
(and perhaps a README with your details, and dataset info/licensing)

Please be mindful of licensing restrictions on datasets, in some cases
it's ok to download and play with them, but not to (re)distribute.
In that case, just put info in for people to get that dataset, for
instance wget <someurl>

Also, dataset licensing generally does not permit you to just place an
app that uses it online, or commercial uses. In that case it's just ok
(and still very handy!) for local experiments and demos.
Always check the details for an individual example dataset.
